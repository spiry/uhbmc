<div class="rd"><h1>What is this about?</h1>
<p>Welcome to the newest feature of the UHBMCC, the Statistics. If that brings up bad memories of school mathematics, rest assured, you do not have to remember all that stuff.<br />
This section is more to be like the Guiness Book of Records, a list of being first, biggest, longest. I intend to extend this section over the months to come with stuff like<br />
&bull; Which creator had the longest run on which series?<br />
&bull; Which pair of creators did the most work together?<br />
&bull; Who is stronger, the Hulk or Thor? (just kiding)<br />
So if you have any record or statistics you think is of interest to assembled Marvel fandom, just mail it to me and I'll be glad to add it to this page.</p><div class="bu"><button type="button" title="Go to top of page" onclick="window.location.href='#top'"><a href="#top">Top</a></button></div></div>
<div class="rd"><h1>Shortest code name</h1>
<p>Lets start with something easy: Which character has the shortest code name?<br />
That simply has to be Monet St. Croix, called 'M'. Place two are shared by the Ox (Raymond and Ronald Bloch) and J2 (Zane Yama), the son of the Juggernaut in the M2 Universe. Place three is shared by a lot of characters with names like Cat, Fox, Gee, Sif.</p><div class="bu"><button type="button" title="Go to top of page" onclick="window.location.href='#top'"><a href="#top">Top</a></button></div></div>
<div class="rd"><h1>Number 500 - The Ranking</h1>
<p>As the Marvel heroes have been around for a while now, some of their series managed to get an issue number of 500 (or even above, see below). The following lists these issues.<br />My personal problem is that how the number was made up by Marvel seems random. Like, for Thor they count the numbers of the preceeding series (Journey into Mystery), but they do not for Spider-Man or others. And while Iron Man appeared in Tales to Astonish long before Captain America, it was Cap who continued the numbering of ToS, so he reached the #500 way before shellhead. Marvel does not count the #-1 issues, although they were part of the regular series. And some other odd things more, like counting reprint issues.<br />Anyhow, for what ever reason, Marvel did publish it this way:</p><p>1) <a href="thor.htm#S145N500">Thor (I)</a> #500 in 1996/07 was preceeded by <a href="jourmyst.htm#S388">Journey into Mystery (I)</a> (#1-125) and <a href="thor.htm#S145">Thor (I)</a> (#126-499).</p><p>Should have been 2) <a href="capamer6.htm#S460N33">Captain America (III)</a> #33 in 2000/09 is Captain America's #500, preceeded by <a href="talesusp.htm#S594">Tales of Suspense (I)</a> (#1-99), <a href="capamer2.htm#S35">Captain America (I)</a> (#100-454), <a href="capamer8.htm#S380">Captain America (II)</a> (#1-13) and <a href="capamer6.htm#S460">Captain America (III)</a> (#1-32).</p><p>Should have been 3) <a href="hulk6.htm#S638N26">Incredible Hulk (III)</a> #26 in 2001/05 is the Hulk's #500, preceeded by <a href="taleasto.htm#S713">Tales to Astonish (I)</a> (#1-101), <a href="hulk2.htm#S97">The Incredible Hulk (II)</a> (#102-474), <a href="hulk9.htm#S2499">Hulk (II)</a> (#1-11) and <a href="hulk6.htm#S638">Incredible Hulk (III)</a> (#12-25). (Using the methode of counting applied for the #600 too.)</p><p>2) <a href="fantfo11.htm#S4181N500">Fantastic Four (IV)</a> #500 in 2003/09 was preceeded by <a href="fantfou.htm#S74">Fantastic Four (I)</a> (#1-416), <a href="fantfou5.htm#S379">Fantastic Four (II)</a> (#1-13) and <a href="fantfou6.htm#S462">Fantastic Four (III)</a> (#1-70).</p><p>3) <a href="spidem17.htm#S4077N500">The Amazing Spider-Man (III)</a> #500 in 2003/12 was preceeded by <a href="spidema2.htm#S11">The Amazing Spider-Man (I)</a> (#1-441) and <a href="spidem25.htm#S593">The Amazing Spider-Man (II)</a> (#1-58).</p><p>4) <a href="avenge19.htm#S4550N500">Avengers (IV)</a> #500 in 2004/09 was preceeded by <a href="avenger.htm#S20">Avengers (I)</a> (#1-402), <a href="avenge12.htm#S377">Avengers (II)</a> (#1-13) and <a href="avenger6.htm#S472">Avengers (III)</a> (#1-84).</p><p>5) <a href="xmen.htm#S227N500">Uncanny X-Men (I)</a> #500 in 2008/09 was preceeded by #1-499 of that series. A straight run, although issues #67-93 (27 issues, after all) were only reprints.</p><p>6) <a href="darede16.htm#S2428N500">Daredevil (III)</a> #500 in 2009/10 was preceeded by <a href="daredev.htm#S49">Daredevil (I)</a> (#1-380) and <a href="daredev3.htm#S518">Daredevil (II)</a> (#1-119).</p><p>7) <a href="ironma16.htm#S4733N500">Invincible Iron Man (VI)</a> #500 in 2011/03 was preceeded by <a href="ironman2.htm#S103">Iron Man (I)</a> (#1-332), <a href="ironman6.htm#S387">Iron Man (II)</a> (#1-13), <a href="ironman3.htm#S476">Iron Man (III)</a> (#1-89), <a href="ironman8.htm#S4745">Iron Man (IV)</a> (#1-32) and <a href="ironman7.htm#S8305">The Invincible Iron Man (V)</a> (#1-33). (Marvel did not count <a href="ironman8.htm#S4745">Iron Man (IV)</a> (#33-35), because they feature War Machine - however had no problems counting Ben Reilly's run as Spider-Man.)</p><p>And strange as it may seem - that's it. There are no more candidates for a long time to come. All other characters that started out in the 60ies - Nick Fury, the Sub-Mariner, Dr. Strange, the Silver Surfer, Captain Marvel, the Black Panther - did not hold on to a (more or less) continuous run of issues or even series.<br /><br />The same is valid for the characters introduced in the 70ies - with the exception of the Punisher but he he has a long time until he hits the #500.<br /><br />It looks a little bit better for Wolverine, who may be the only character from the 80ies who one day could make the 500.</p><div class="bu"><button type="button" title="Go to top of page" onclick="window.location.href='#top'"><a href="#top">Top</a></button></div></div>

<div class="rd"><h1>Longest run of writer/artist</h1>
<p>Between 1961/11 and 1970/09 Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created 102 issues of <a href="fantfou.htm#S74">Fantastic Four (I)</a> and 6 issues of <a href="fantfou2.htm#S71">Fantastic Four Annual (I)</a>, adding up to 108 Fantastic Four issues.<br />
A record, that was surpassed only recently: From 2000/11 to 2007/09 Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley created 111 (continuous) issues of <a href="uspiderm.htm#S2860">Ultimate Spider-Man (I)</a>.<br />
Still, "The Man" and "The King" together created more comics than any other team-up in Marvel history, considering that during their time at Fantastic Four, they also worked together on series like <a href="avenger.htm#S20">Avengers (I)</a>, <a href="jourmyst.htm#S388">Journey into Mystery (I)</a>, and <a href="hulk.htm#S733">Incredible Hulk (I)</a> - not even counting their work before the Silver Age of Marvel.</p><div class="bu"><button type="button" title="Go to top of page" onclick="window.location.href='#top'"><a href="#top">Top</a></button></div></div>
