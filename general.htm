<p>After DC had cancelled its contract with Diamond Comics as distributor, the number of comics shipped to Vienna each week has diminished considerably. That resulted in that U.S. comics are only delivered every second week to the local shops here. And as the past few weeks have shown, not even that is a sure thing. But that also means that I cannot say in advance when my hopepage will be updated, as I do not want it updated with weeks of the newest comics missing. My intention is to make the update within a week after Marvel Previews has been published, but due to shipping delays it could end up another week (and hopefully not more) later.</p><div class="bu"><button type="button" title="Go to top of page" onclick="window.location.href='#top'"><a href="#top">Top</a></button></div></div>

<a name="A2" id="A2"></a><div class="rd"><h1>What is this web site about?</h1>
<p>The long-time goal of this web site is to list all comics ever published by Marvel Comics and give to each comic when it was published and who was the creative team. Further it provides a list of storyarcs and crossovers, a list of published comics sorted by date, an index to the people who bring you your favorite comics, a list showing where a comic has been reprinted and an index for the appearance of characters.<br />
The task to gather and complete the data is twofold: On the one side all new comics published by Marvel Comics are listed and on the other side the comics of the past are completed. Especially the gathering of old information is time-consuming - and all and any help is appreciated. And slowly but steady the goal will be reached.</p>
<p>The UHBMCC originally started as a two men enterprise (Paulo and Markus), but in the meantime many people have joined in the task of completing this web site (See the "Thanks to..." page for all the details). Some are just dropping a line to correct even a minor error, others came to the rescue for many months and many missing data. I would like to say a big <b>THANK YOU</b> to all of you for sharing your time and the dream!<br />
Especially the following guys who have been helping me through the last years and month by month with missing data, corrections, checking the data I already have, and providing suggestions, insights and a second point-of-view that leads to improvement of the UHBMCC:</p>

<p>On the left side of the screen you can see twelve symbols. Moving the mouse over one of these symbols will open a menu bar with additional informations. Click on the symbol or the menu bar to go to the requested page.</p>
<p>Seven symbols lead to the data of the comicbooks with different categories: Sorted by the series' names and grouped by the main character(s); sorted by storyarcs connecting several issues; sorted by the creators; sorted by dates; reprint issues and collections sorted by the original series' names; sorted by character apperances; and finally sorted by the publishers. For these seven categories the menu bar changes to a list of letters (or in the case of dates, a list of years). Clicking on the letter or the year will bring you straight to the chosen part of the category from where you can delve deeper into the the required data.</p>
<p>The type of the series shown in the series overview can be:</p>
<ul><li><img src="tyos.png" />Oneshot</li>
<li><img src="tyli.png" />Limited series or mini series</li>
<li><img src="tyog.png" />Ongoing series (also when it was announced as such but then cancelled after a few issues)</li>

<a name="A12" id="A12"></a><div class="rd"><h1>Rating</h1>
<p>(Many thanks to Barry Pearl for re-writing this section with additional info that I did not have.)<br />
There was no rating of comics before the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">C</span>omic <span style="text-decoration:underline;">C</span>ode <span style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span>uthority was installed in 1955. Starting then, all of Marvel's comics had to be approved by the CCA or they could not be distributed to dealers. When the rebirth of Marvel's super hero comics began with Fantastic Four #1 in 1961 the CCA stamp was on all Marvel comics. Until the "anti-drug use issues" in Amazing Spider-Man #96-98 published in 1971. At this time any references to drugs, even if they were shown to be harmful, were not allowed. In 1971, a government agency, who knew nothing about the CCA, wrote to Stan Lee asking for anti drug stories. Stan, a smart guy, knew that he could use this as a political wedge to change the code and he got a huge amount of publicity out of it too!  And by that time, comic book stores started opening so he knew sales would not be affected. By 1971, the new stand dealers had even forgotten about the code anyhow. Marvel's publication of these stories triggered a major revamping of the 15 year old code that same year. This revamping now allowed comics to portray not just drugs use, but vampires, werewolves and mummies. These horror standards soon "exploded" onto the Marvel schedule.<br /><br />
Nudity, Zombies and other "adult" themes were still barred by the CCA, but Marvel started a Black and White line of publications that were not subjected to the CCA. It should be noted that vampires were considered "the living dead" and were allowed by the CCA, but zombies were considered "the walking dead" and were not allowed.<br /><br />
Stan Lee said once in a "Stan's Soapbox" that he sees no problem with the Comic Code, because it is very similar to the internal policy of Marvel. This was because Marvel's internal policy had to conform to the code or their comics could not be published or distributed. Before the code, in the 1940s and 1950s, their standards, as portrayed in their stories, were quite different. In later years, Stan Lee and other creators from Marvel, have given examples of materials that were changed or deleted because of the censorship of the code.<br /><br />
In 2001 X-Force #116 was published and Marvel saw a problem, because this issue is not CCA approved, but it did not affect sales like it would have in 1955 when comics were only sold at newsstands. From that time on, Marvel dropped the CCA stamp completely and for a few months there was no rating of the comics at all.<br /><br />
Then Marvel installed following system (taken from Marvel Previews #20 2005/06):<br />
<b>All ages</b> - Appropriate for for readers of all ages (like the Marvel Age series).<br />
<b>A</b>, <b>T</b> - Appropriate for ages 9 and up.<br />
<b>PG</b> (Parental Guidance), <b>PSR</b> (Parental Supervision Recommended), <b>T+</b> (Suggested for Teens and Up) - Appropriate for most readers, parents are advised they may want to read before or with younger children (13+ years).<br />
<b>PG+</b>, <b>PSR+</b>, <b>Parental Advisory</b> - Suggested for teen and up, but featuring more mature themes and/or more graphic imagery. Recommended for teen and adult readers. (15+ years).<br />
<b>MA</b> (Mature Audience), <b>"Explicit Content"</b> - Most Mature Readers books will fall under the MAX Comics banner, created specifically for mature content titles. (18+ years).<br />
Many series that Marvel publishes today get the rating "PSR"/"T+", many get "All Ages" and a few get "PSR+"/"PA" or "MA/EC". So that you can find these non-"PSR" series quicker, I have added a list of these series to my site. When you select the "Character/Series" tab, and go to the addendum, you'll find the links to these lists as "RATING:". All other navigating is as usual.<br /><br />
Marvel submitted not all comics to the CCA. Especially the black and white magazines that emerged after the Code was modified were not rated - in most cases that meant that they contained violence of nudity. The same can be said about the Epic line of comics, which was intented for mature readers in most cases anyway.<br />
Alas, trade paperbacks that reprint CCA-approved comics were also not rated. And for unknown reasons a few issues throughout the years do not bear the CCA seal without any obvious reason, so I assume it was just an error during production.<br />
Therefore the rating "Not rated" can have many reasons and does not necessarily mean that a comic is adult-oriented. For TPBs a look at the rating of the original issues can be helpful. In the cases where there is no rating, the contents however is obvious for mature readers or it looks as if the CCA seal has been omitted during production, I took the liberty to add a rating although the original book does not have it.</p><div class="bu"><button type="button" title="Go to top of page" onclick="window.location.href='#top'"><a href="#top">Top</a></button></div></div>
